    Attributes
    ----------
    margin : float
        Minimum required margin between `min_intraclass_dist` and
        `max_interclass_dist`.
    reduction : str
        Name of torch function for reducing loss vector to a scalar. Set
        to "mean" by default to mimic CrossEntropyLoss default
        parameter.

    Notes
    -----
    The loss calculation involves the following plain-English steps:

    For each image in the training batch...
        1. Compare its feature vector to all FVs in the comparison batch
            using a distance function. (L2-norm/Euclidean used here.)
        2. Find the minimum interclass distance (y_trn != y_cmp) and
            maximum intraclass distance (y_trn == y_cmp)
        3. Check that the difference between these two distances is
            greater than a specified margin.

        Explanation:
            -The minimum interclass distance should be large, as FVs
                from src/tgt pairs should be as distinct as possible
                when their classes are different.
            -The maximum intraclass distance should be small, as FVs
                from src/tgt pairs should be as similar as possible
                when their classes are the same.
            -Therefore, these conditions should be true:
                              `min_interclass` >> `max_interclass`
           `min_interclass` - `max_interclass` >> `margin`

        4. Calculate loss for cases where the difference is NOT greater
            than the margin, as that would invalidate the conditions
            above. Here, loss == abs(difference).
